                        <p>Hi, I'm Cody Mart. I'm currently a student in DevCodeCamp's web development course. I grew up in a small town in Kansas I made the decision to join the military when I was 26 years old so I could do more with my life. After 3.5 years serving and 1 tour of Afghanistan, I decided to part ways with the military and utilize my GI Bill. I spent 3 years at Long Beach City College when I decided to move to Washington. After working as a septic maintenance specialist for 2 years I wanted something more, this is when I decided to attend a coding bootcamp. After graduating from the software development camp I wanted more. I enrolled in the MERN web development course and here I am!</p>
